# Publishing
![CI](https://github.com/example/publishing/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

This repository hosts a simple publishing workflow demo. Database schema is maintained with Entity Framework Core migrations.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

* Docker Desktop with at least **4 GB RAM**
* [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
* [Git 2.34](https://git-scm.com/) or newer

For Windows Home users follow [Microsoft's guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/containers/docker-desktop) to enable Linux containers.

## Configuration

The `Publishing.UI` project contains an `appsettings.json` file with a default connection string pointing to LocalDB.  The project file copies this file to the output directory so both the application and `dotnet ef` commands can use it automatically. During startup a dedicated initializer applies pending EF Core migrations so the schema stays in sync with the models.

See [Data-access conventions](Data-access conventions.md) for details on the Query Object pattern used for database access.

All EF Core migration files must be compiled so `Database.MigrateAsync()` can locate them during integration tests. If the EF tools added them as `None` items, ensure they are built with:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <Compile Update="Migrations\**\*.cs" />
</ItemGroup>
```

### Custom Connection String

`src/Publishing.UI/appsettings.json` defines `ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection`. Update this value to point to a different SQL Server instance. The default connection string now includes `TrustServerCertificate=True` to suppress SSL certificate warnings when using a self-signed SQL Server certificate:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=My-PC;Initial Catalog=Publishing;Integrated Security=true;TrustServerCertificate=True"
  }
}
```

`Program.cs` also loads environment variables, so you can override the setting at runtime with `ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection`.

## Working with migrations

1. Install the EF Core tools if needed:

```bash
 dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 6.0.*
```

2. Add a new migration from the `Publishing.Infrastructure` project directory. For the first migration, name it `InitialCreate`:

```bash
 dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName> --project src/Publishing.Infrastructure --output-dir Migrations
```

3. Apply migrations to the configured database:

```bash
 dotnet ef database update --project src/Publishing.Infrastructure
```

The `DesignTimeDbContextFactory` allows the EF CLI to resolve `AppDbContext` without requiring the UI project.

In CI pipelines you can apply migrations automatically using:

```bash
dotnet ef database update --project src/Publishing.Infrastructure
```

A GitHub Actions workflow under `.github/workflows/ci.yml` demonstrates how to build the solution and run tests automatically during CI.  The pipeline runs on Linux and Windows, publishing a NuGet package with custom analyzers.  Code coverage fails the build if it drops below **85%**.

## Testing

* **Unit tests** run with the EF Core InMemory provider.
* **Integration tests** use SQLite files for speed. SQLite's SQL dialect differs
  from SQL Server, so passing tests here should be treated as a quick sanity
  check rather than proof that all queries work with SQL Server.
* A few tests run against SQL Server via Testcontainers when T-SQL features are involved.

## Price calculation and discounts

Orders use a `PriceCalculator` service to determine the final cost. This calculator resolves an `IDiscountPolicy` from the DI container so different promotions can adjust the base price. Register the default policy in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
services.AddScoped<IDiscountPolicy, StandardDiscountPolicy>();
```

New strategies can be provided by registering a different implementation without touching `PriceCalculator`.
Components should obtain `PriceCalculator` via dependency injection rather than constructing it directly.

## UI Notifications

User-facing messages are routed through `IUiNotifier`. In WinForms builds a
system tray balloon appears, while console services write the text to `stdout`.
When the application runs without a graphical environment, only log entries are
produced.

Register the notifier via extension:

```csharp
var host = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
    .ConfigureServices(services =>
    {
        services.AddUiNotifier();
    })
    .Build();
```

Call the appropriate method depending on context:

| Method | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| `NotifyInfo` | Successful actions |
| `NotifyWarning` | Validation or minor issues |
| `NotifyError` | Exceptions and failures |

In unit tests `IUiNotifier` can be replaced with a stub:

```csharp
var factory = new WebApplicationFactory<Program>()
    .WithWebHostBuilder(b =>
    {
        b.ConfigureTestServices(services =>
        {
            services.AddSingleton<IUiNotifier, StubNotifier>();
        });
    });
```

Set `NOTIFICATIONS_DISABLED=true` to suppress all UI output. The Windows job in CI uses this flag except when running WinAppDriver tests.

## Static Analysis

Custom Roslyn analyzers enforce the notifier registration and forbid APIs like `MessageBox.Show` or the `#if WINDOWS` directive. Run `dotnet format analyzers` to apply automatic fixes before committing.

## Localization & Accessibility

Notification texts reside in `Notifications.resx` with Ukrainian translations in `Notifications.uk-UA.resx`. Create new culture-specific files to extend the UI. Access strings via `ResourceManager`. Tests ensure translations exist for every key.


## Microservices setup

Each service resides in `src/Publishing.<Name>.Service` with its own `Dockerfile`.
Start the whole stack using:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The API gateway project under `src/ApiGateway` routes requests to the services. Swagger is enabled for each service at `/swagger` and health checks are exposed at `/health`.
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the connection strings and JWT settings before starting the stack. Required variables are `SA_PASSWORD`, `ACCEPT_EULA`, `DB_CONN`, `REDIS_CONN`, `RABBIT_CONN`, `JWT__Issuer`, `JWT__Audience` and `JWT__SigningKey`.
The signing key must be at least 32 characters long when using the default HS256 algorithm. The issuer, audience and key must match the values used to sign JWT tokens consumed by the services.
Set `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development` in the compose file (or `.env`) to enable Swagger inside the containers. Change or remove this variable to run the services in production.
Database migrations now apply **asynchronously** during startup and each service reports readiness via `/health`.
All API routes require an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header containing a JWT signed with the configured key.
When browsing Swagger, use the **Authorize** button to provide a token for authenticated requests.
Persistent volumes `db-data` and `redis-data` preserve SQL Server and Redis data between restarts. The services automatically apply EF Core migrations using the `DB_CONN` connection string. All containers join the `micro-net` Docker network so the gateway can resolve service names. Swagger can also be reached through the gateway under `/orders/swagger`, `/profile/swagger` and `/organization/swagger`.
RabbitMQ runs as `rabbit` on port `5672` for publishing order events used by statistics.

Each service enables Redis caching via `REDIS_CONN`, OpenTelemetry tracing with a console exporter and secures endpoints using CORS and JWT bearer authentication. Contract tests live under `src/tests/Publishing.Contracts.Tests` and verify API compatibility using Pact. These tests run automatically via the `contracts.yml` GitHub Actions workflow.

## CI/CD

Several additional GitHub workflows build Docker images for the services and push
them to Docker Hub. To allow these workflows to authenticate, create repository
secrets named `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` containing your Docker Hub
credentials. Without these secrets the `Login & Push` steps will fail with an
"incorrect username or password" error.

For details on running UI tests see [docs/ui-testing.md](docs/ui-testing.md).
The Windows job in CI executes these tests with WinAppDriver. When testing locally install WinAppDriver via winget or the MSI package as it is not included with the NuGet package.
